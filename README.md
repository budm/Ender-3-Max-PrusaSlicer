# Ender-3-Max-PrusaSlicer
Download PrusaSlicer here: https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer/releases.

This is my basic profile for normal printing with PLA. Temperatures are set at 205/60. This profile is the basis for what will be my Ender-3 MAX profile without any modifications (Maybe a BLTOUCH down the road). If you have an Ender-3 MAX with some adjustments, you may need to play with some printing parameters.

I will be working on a PETG profile and an ABS Profile in the near future, as those are what I primarily work with on my other printers, and they will be what this printer uses ones it gets put to use in the farm.

As of posting this profile it is untested, but I assume it is good, but I am not responsible for anything that may occur. 

# GCODE
The G-Code provided is basic PrusaSlicer G-Code, will make adjustments as time goes on, any major changes will be put here

# Installation
You add the profile to the slicer via the menu item File -> Import -> Import Configuration.

# Save profiles
To save profiles permanently, click on the floppy disk next to the profile name on each of the tabs, and rename the profile. Without renaming, your profiles will not be saved. You need to do this on all tabs, ie Print Settings, Filament Settings and also Printer Settings
